# What does this project do?

This is a daily habit tracker for visual reinforcement of habits we want to follow

[Habits are categorized for easy reading, managed for editing and marking complete]

=> A habit must have a category

=> Daily Tasks will list tasks per category

=> Manage option allows user to edit habit text, mark a habit as done or delete a habit

=> Categories can be added and deleted

=> Using tailwind.css we have menu items that will be highlighted when clicked
